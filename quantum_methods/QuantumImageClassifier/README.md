# QuantumClassifier ðŸŒ€

Welcome to the **QuantumClassifier**, where we attempt to push the boundaries of machine learning on quantum hardware, only to discover that sometimes those boundaries push back... hard. Letâ€™s just say, the journey from classical to quantum isnâ€™t always smooth, but hey, weâ€™re learning!

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: A Very Humble Beginning

So, hereâ€™s where weâ€™re at right now. The classifier is up and running, using **Qiskit** for quantum data encoding and a simple parameterized ansatz, but thereâ€™s a bit of a catch... Weâ€™ve had to **downgrade the MNIST images from 28x28 pixels to a whopping 3x3 pixels** (yup, you read that right ðŸ˜…). If youâ€™re thinking "How can anything work with 3x3 pixel images?"â€”well, youâ€™d be correct. It doesnâ€™t work so great.

### Test Accuracy: **12.50%**

Thatâ€™s right, folksâ€”**12.50%**. You can flip a coin and probably do better, but weâ€™re running quantum circuits, so thatâ€™s kind of cool, right? The poor accuracy is mainly due to the harsh data downgrading and the fact that our **feature map** isnâ€™t doing us any favors either. Hereâ€™s the basic feature map weâ€™re using:

```python
def parameterized_scaled_angle_encoding(num_qubits, scale_factor=np.pi):
    """
    Parameterized Angle Encoding with Feature Scaling.

    Parameters:
    - num_qubits (int): Number of qubits in the circuit.
    - scale_factor (float): Scaling factor to adjust rotation angles.

    Returns:
    - QuantumCircuit: Parameterized quantum circuit implementing scaled angle encoding.
    """
    qr = QuantumRegister(num_qubits, name='q')
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(qr)
    data_parameters = ParameterVector('x', num_qubits)
    for i in range(num_qubits):
        angle = data_parameters[i] * scale_factor
        circuit.ry(angle, qr[i])
    return circuit
```

### Whatâ€™s Going Wrong?

Well, weâ€™ve got **bad data** (3x3 pixels is barely recognizable as an image) and a **less-than-optimal feature map** that essentially just rotates the vector before passing it into a simple ansatz:

```python
def parameterized_ansatz(num_qubits, parameters):
    """
    Parameterized Ansatz.

    Constructs a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) with RY and RZ gates and entangling CX gates.

    Parameters:
    - num_qubits (int): Number of qubits in the circuit.
    - parameters (ParameterVector): List of parameters for rotation gates.

    Returns:
    - QuantumCircuit: Parameterized quantum circuit implementing the ansatz.
    """
    qr = QuantumRegister(num_qubits, name='q')
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(qr)
    param_idx = 0
    for i in range(num_qubits):
        circuit.ry(parameters[param_idx], qr[i])
        param_idx += 1
        circuit.rz(parameters[param_idx], qr[i])
        param_idx += 1
    # Entangling layer
    for i in range(num_qubits - 1):
        circuit.cx(qr[i], qr[i + 1])
    return circuit
```

### Why So Humble?

Quantum hardware is **super powerful**, but right now, weâ€™re **limited to simulations** on classical hardware, and simulating more than a handful of qubits is like trying to squeeze an elephant into a phone boothâ€”just not gonna happen. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re working with only **9 qubits** and an **extremely simplified feature map**, which obviously leaves room for improvement.

## ðŸš€ The Plan for the Future

But donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ve got big plans! This is just a **starting point**â€”and yes, itâ€™s probably the **worst possible starting point**â€”but itâ€™s important to lay down the groundwork:

- **Improved Feature Maps**: Weâ€™ll try more sophisticated encodings to see if we can squeeze out more accuracy.
- **Better Ansatz Designs**: The current ansatz is pretty basic. Weâ€™ll experiment with more complex and hardware-efficient versions.
- **Testing on Real Quantum Hardware**: Simulations are one thing, but once we run these circuits on **actual quantum computers**, things could get a lot more interesting. 

One thing to note: **hardware-efficient ansÃ¤tze** are likely going to differ significantly from the ones that show the best results during simulations, so weâ€™ll be testing and refining everything to ensure the circuits work well on real quantum devices.
