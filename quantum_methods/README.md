# Quantum Methods üß†‚öõÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Quantum Methods** section, where I experiment with a range of **quantum techniques** aimed at feature mapping, kernel methods, and quantum-based machine learning. After working with tensor network models and achieving strong results on classical hardware, my goal is now to **bring those results to quantum hardware**. 

## üåü Current Focus

The current project revolves around using **quantum circuits** to classify images from the **MNIST dataset**. After achieving great accuracy with tensor-based methods like MPS, I want to see how quantum hardware can take on the same task, aiming to build a **Quantum Classifier** that competes with or surpasses classical approaches.

### Techniques I‚Äôm Playing With:

1. **Feature Mapping**: Experimenting with different quantum feature maps that transform classical data into a quantum state. I‚Äôm testing several strategies, from **basic angle encoding** to more complex **parameterized maps**, trying to find the right balance between accuracy and hardware efficiency.

2. **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)**: Using VQC kernels to create flexible quantum machine learning models. These circuits act like a quantum version of neural networks, adjusting parameters during training to find the optimal quantum state for classification.

3. **Swap Test & Hadamard Inner Product**: A lot of my current work involves exploring **swap tests** and **Hadamard-based approaches** to perform inner product calculations directly on quantum hardware. This could lead to more efficient ways of comparing quantum states, crucial for tasks like **kernel methods**.

### The Challenge

Quantum computing is still in its early stages, and simulating quantum circuits on classical hardware limits the scale of experiments. Right now, I‚Äôm working with small versions of MNIST (like **3x3 pixel grids**) due to qubit and simulation limitations, but the goal is to eventually test these methods on **real quantum hardware**.

## üéØ Future Goals

While MNIST classification is the first target, the bigger vision is to:

- **Polish my skills** in working with quantum methods across all types of data (time series, financial data, etc.).
- Investigate how classical techniques used in machine learning‚Äîlike **support vector machines**, **neural networks**, and **kernel methods**‚Äîcan be adapted or enhanced with **quantum alternatives**.
- **Find quantum solutions** that are as effective, if not better, than classical methods, potentially revolutionizing how we handle large, complex datasets.

The ultimate aim is to **bridge the gap** between classical machine learning and quantum computing, exploring new frontiers where quantum methods may offer more **efficient or powerful solutions**.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next?

As I continue this journey, the next steps will include:

- Improving **feature mapping** techniques to better encode classical data for quantum processing.
- Testing the efficiency of **swap tests** for inner product calculations in quantum kernels.
