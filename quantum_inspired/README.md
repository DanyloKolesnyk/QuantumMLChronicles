# Quantum Inspired üê¢

Welcome to the **Quantum Inspired** section, where I explore the practical use of **tensor networks** and other quantum mechanical principles in machine learning. Here, you'll find techniques that aim to outperform classical methods, but often need more time and research to get there. If we‚Äôre achieving significant progress along the way, I'd say it's a win.

## Overview

In this folder, I experiment with **quantum-inspired approaches** to machine learning. These techniques borrow from the mathematics of quantum mechanics‚Äîlike tensor networks, state optimization, and entanglement‚Äîand apply them to real machine learning and optimization problems.

### What's Inside?

This folder is organized into multiple sections, each dedicated to a specific quantum-inspired technique:

1. **DMRG Techniques**:
   - Currently, my main focus is on exploring **Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)** techniques. These methods are crucial for optimizing tensor networks, especially in higher-dimensional data and more complex models.

2. **MNIST Classification with MPS**:
   - Implementations of **Matrix Product States (MPS)** for classifying images from the MNIST dataset. Includes both gradient-optimized methods and simplified averaging approaches.

## What‚Äôs Next?

Expect more approaches soon! My main interest now is to look into **DMRG techniques** to further optimize tensor networks and explore new quantum-inspired algorithms.

Other ideas I'm working on:

- **PEPS (Projected Entangled Pair States)**: Extending the MPS framework into two dimensions.

## Why Quantum (Even If It Works Just as Well)?

Because it‚Äôs **quantum**, and it's exciting to explore these new approaches. As the world shifts towards quantum computing, these methods might become crucial for leveraging quantum algorithms in machine learning. It's also important to build bridges between classical and quantum approaches, as these transitions will be needed continuously in the future.

## Stay Tuned!

This folder will be regularly updated with new approaches, both simple and complex. Whether they work better than classical methods or not, it‚Äôs all about the journey and what we learn along the way.
