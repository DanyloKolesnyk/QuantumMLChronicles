# QuantumMLChronicles 🐉

**Welcome to QuantumMLChronicles**, where I, **Kolesnyk Danylo**, a student at **TUM** (Technische Universität München), explore the world of **quantum computing** and **machine learning**. This repository is a blend of everything I've learned from **lectures, papers, seminars, and labs**, along with my own experiments (read: trial and error, because science).

## 🐢 What’s This All About?

The main goal here is to **bridge classical and quantum computing** in the realm of machine learning. While some of the approaches might not outperform classical methods just yet, they represent steps toward a future where quantum computing has a significant impact on AI.

This is where theory meets practice, and occasionally where theory meets a wall. But each experiment is a learning experience. My aim is to **explore**, experiment, and maybe come up with something groundbreaking—or at least worth a few curious looks.

## 🔬 What’s Inside?

Here, you’ll find a mix of different approaches—some classical methods with a quantum twist and some quantum algorithms running on **classical hardware** for now. But there's also the plan to run these on **real quantum hardware** (thanks, Qiskit!) whenever we can.

### 1. **Quantum Inspired**

This is where tensor networks come in. My main focus has been on optimizing **Matrix Product States (MPS)** with gradient-based methods, achieving **95% accuracy** on the MNIST dataset in just seconds. Quantum-inspired efficiency meets practical machine learning! This is a big leap in applying tensor networks to real-world tasks.

I've also tried a simplified version, where I average quantum states for each digit class—still getting **80%+ accuracy**. But the real magic is in the gradient-optimized MPS: it's fast, accurate, and shows what quantum-inspired techniques can do for ML.

### 2. **QuantumCircuitClassifier**

This is where **Qiskit** gets involved. I'm using **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)** to see how far we can push quantum circuits for ML tasks. We're limited to a few qubits for now, but hey, quantum is about efficiency, right? Hopefully, one day we'll see this outperform classical methods without just relying on luck. Fingers crossed.

### 3. **Future Approaches**

I'm always updating this repository, so expect new techniques, experiments, and a few missteps along the way. Upcoming areas include **time series data**, **financial data**, and other complex datasets—all with a quantum or tensor-based twist.

## 🐙 Motivation (Why am I doing this?)

I'm interested in new techniques for quantum machine learning and quantum-inspired algorithms. Quantum computing has the potential to reshape everything from optimization to AI, and exploring this frontier is both challenging and exciting

My motivation isn’t to instantly surpass classical approaches—though that would be great—but rather to build a foundation, learn, and **experiment** with quantum tools. I want to see how quantum computing can **enhance** what we know in machine learning, or even create entirely new paradigms.

## 🤝 Contributions & Collaborations

If you're intrigued by quantum ML, feel free to contribute! Whether it’s refining code, adding new ideas, or discussing approaches, I’m open to collaboration. Check out the issue tracker for things needing attention, or open a pull request if you’ve got something awesome to share!

**Stay tuned** for updates, and don’t forget to ⭐ this repository if you’re curious about how quantum computing might change machine learning!
