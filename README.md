# QuantumMLChronicles 🚀

**Welcome to QuantumMLChronicles**, where I, **Kolesnyk Danylo**, a student at **TUM** (Technische Universität München), am diving deep into the fascinating world of **quantum computing** and **machine learning**. This repository is a melting pot of everything I've learned from **lectures, papers, seminars, and labs**, combined with a bit of my own imagination and creativity (read: a lot of trial and error 😅).

## 🌌 What’s This All About?

The main goal of this project is simple: to **bridge classical and quantum computing** in the realm of machine learning. Sure, it sounds grand, and while many of the approaches here might not (yet) outperform their classical counterparts, they represent the first steps toward a future where quantum computing plays a pivotal role in AI. 

This is where theory meets practice, and sometimes, where theory meets a wall and bounces off, but we learn from every experiment. My goal is to **explore** this field, play with ideas, and maybe even come up with something groundbreaking... or at least mildly interesting! 😄

## 🔬 What’s Inside?

Here, you’ll find a collection of different approaches, some of which might be **classical methods with a quantum twist** or quantum algorithms that, for now, run on **classical hardware** (because simulating quantum systems is hard and expensive!). But no worries, as I also plan to run some of these on **real quantum hardware** (thanks, Qiskit!) when we get there.

Here’s what you’ll encounter:

### 1. **Quantum Inspired**
This is where tensor networks truly shine. My main focus here has been on optimizing **Matrix Product States (MPS)** with gradient-based methods, and I’m proud to say that it achieves **95% accuracy** on the MNIST dataset in just a matter of seconds. That’s right—**quantum-inspired** efficiency meets practical machine learning! This is a significant leap in applying tensor networks to real-world tasks. 

I’ve also experimented with a more simplified version, where I average the quantum states for each digit class and use that for classification, which surprisingly holds up with **80%+ accuracy**. But the real magic lies in the gradient-optimized MPS—it's fast, accurate, and showcases the potential of these quantum-inspired methods for ML.

### 2. **QuantumCircuitClassifier**
This is where the **Qiskit magic** happens. Using **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)**, I explore how far we can push quantum circuits to perform ML tasks. Limited to a few qubits for now, but hey, quantum’s all about efficiency, right? And if we’re lucky, maybe someday we’ll outperform a classical classifier by a bit more than luck. Fingers crossed.

### 3. **Future Approaches**
I’m constantly updating this repository, so expect new techniques, experiments, and... let’s face it... more mistakes (and hopefully some successes too). Upcoming areas will likely include **time series data**, **financial data**, and other complex datasets, all with a quantum or tensor-based twist.

## 🧑‍🎓 Motivation (Why am I doing this?)

Because quantum computing is the future! 🌟 The current landscape is classical, but quantum computing promises to reshape everything from optimization to AI, and someone’s gotta start exploring this wild frontier, right? 

My motivation isn’t to immediately surpass classical approaches (though that would be awesome), but rather to build a foundation, learn, and **experiment** with quantum tools. The goal is to figure out how quantum computing can **enhance** what we already know about machine learning, or even create entirely new paradigms.

Besides, let’s be honest—it’s pretty cool to be working with quantum mechanics, and I can impress my friends by throwing in terms like “entanglement” and “superposition” at parties. Well... maybe not at parties, but you get the idea.

## 🤝 Contributions & Collaborations

If you're as intrigued by quantum ML as I am, feel free to contribute! Whether it's helping refine the code, adding new ideas, or just having a conversation about the best approaches, I’m always open to new ideas. Check out the issue tracker for things that need some love, or feel free to open a pull request if you’ve got something awesome to share!

## ⚡ The Future (And why I’m excited)

This repository is just the beginning of my journey into quantum machine learning. As quantum hardware improves and our algorithms evolve, the potential here is limitless. I’m here for the **long game**—exploring the field, learning, and (hopefully) making some real-world contributions. 

Whether this becomes the next big thing or just a small stepping stone in the quantum AI world, it’s all part of the adventure. Join me on this **quantum journey**, and let’s see where it takes us!
